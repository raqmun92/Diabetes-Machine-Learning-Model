# Diabetes-Machine-Learning-Model
This is an analysis of a dataset containing female patients from the Pima Indian population. The population has a high overall likelihood of diabetes so it is a good group to analyze to discover ranges of health qualities that are connected to developing diabetes. As there is a lot of research done on diabetes already, I am treating this as practice for developing a machine learning model.

For this project, I used Python as my programming language as it is the ideal langauge for data analytics. I also used JupyterNotebooks to write my report to streamline the project. I wanted to have notes, code, and graphs all in one document. I also chose to use a support vector classifier model. As they are typically used for classification, regression and outlier detection, I thought it it would be a good fit for the use case.

In future updates, I would like to change the project to use recall as a measurement of success since it is better to have false positives for this use case. I would also prefer to use a bigger dataset since the current one is a bit small. Finally, there were some parts of the data that were unclear.
